When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    Maybe you do not have access to your computer or you are using someone else's computer
    
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Because we may not want to add the changes we made remotely to that on our local machine

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks allows you to edit someone's repository while acknowledging them
    Clones lets us use someone's repository without acknowledging them
    Branches lets us make experimental changes to our projects without losing the last working one.
    

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    You could have access to it if you do not have an internet connection

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    I once tried to use Google drive or Dropbox for collaboration, the difference was so much that it could not even work, Github provides so much freedom in collaboration than any other platform.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    This could be useful when working on new feautures or different versions of a software, it could also be useful when collaborating with others
